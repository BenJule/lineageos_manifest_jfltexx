# LineageOS
## Getting Started
To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get familiar with Git and Repo.

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:

```
repo init -u https://github.com/BenJule/lineageos_manifest_jfltexx.git -b n
```
Then to sync up:

```
repo sync
```
